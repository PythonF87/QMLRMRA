QuantaMental Logistic Regression Mean Reversion Stock Screener
This is my final project for Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering Professional Certificate in Applied Data Science. 
The basis of the project is to narrow down a list of stocks (from an indice or otherwise) to perform futher research on.
To qualify, the stocks must include statistics following criteria in line with the standards set by the logistic regression algorithm.
These criteria are based on the stock's: Z-Score, Rolling Average Slope, and Earnings Growth Trend.
As standard, the criteria will be met at a z-score of -1.5 or lower, a positive 5 year rolling average slope, and positive earnings over the past 4 years.
The outcome of this algorithm will be a list and tailord graphs depicting the stocks meeting all 3 criteria.
Upon completion, the user is tasked to select the most relative stocks they believe qualify as a "value investment".
